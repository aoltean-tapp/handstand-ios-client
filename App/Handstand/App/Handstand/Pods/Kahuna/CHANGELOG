- We are migrating data out of NSUserDefaults into our own private data store. The reason
for this move is some crashes that were reported to us when the SDK tries to synchronize
the NSUserDefaults. NSUserDefaults being a common store for the app and all the SDK it 
loads, this is always a potential risk for our SDK. Typical reason for crash is a doubly 
released object that still is retained by the NSUserDefaults.

-------------------------
- Critical bug fix for deepIntegration mode.

-------------------------
390 - March 24, 2014
